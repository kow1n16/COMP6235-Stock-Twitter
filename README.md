# COMP6235-Stock-Twitter

This web application analyzes Twitter sentiment and intraday stock price data to see if there is a common trend between the two. 

Organizations chosen for stock price data are food chain giants Mcdonald's and Starbucks. 

The application consists of charts which have been visualized after data collection, processing and analysis.
